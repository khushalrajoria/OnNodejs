make a REST API with JSON

so in order to make it hybrid for apps and browers we should be changing GET/user to GET/api/user

GET/api/user - get all the users - Done
GET/api/user/1 - get users with ID =1 - done
GET/api/user/2 - get users with ID =2 - done

here 1 and 2 in the path are ---> Dynamic path parameters
GET/api/user/:id  ---> colan means that it is dynamic

POST/user - create a user

PATCH/user/1 - Edit user with with ID =1
DELETE/api/user/1 - Edit user with with ID =1

for database we will generate a fake databse for testing purpose - mockaroo.com
