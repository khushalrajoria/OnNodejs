Verisons 

lile 4.19.2
so 2 here is minor fixes (optional) ---> like spelling changes or very small non necessary changes
19 is ---> Recommended bux fixes -> like some security or some part being added
4 is major release -> major or breaking update ( apne paas ek 4 version me ho aur apan 5 karde usko toh apna code break ho sakta hai itna bada update)

if we want to download a specific version we can do that by ---> npm install express@4.18.2

^ -> carrot symbol locks major release - install all minor update and Recommended automatically
^4.17.2 -> when we update express it will automatically update it (on npm update) but only till the 4 is intact not 5.0.0

~ -> squguely -> locks both Major and Recommended Verisons
