in the real terms REST API means when a client ask server for a data, a server return data in rendered form like a html page or anything else
this is very fast and is called as SSR but in cases where the client an be a laptop that needs a HTML rendering or mobile that means flutter type 
rendering but SSR will only provide one type of rendered data

so in rest API server only provide raw data in JSON format and then rendering is done from client side
