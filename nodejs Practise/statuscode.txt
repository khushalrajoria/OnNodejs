so status codes are used to indicate different things

Here is the text extracted from the image in the same format:

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been
successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

1. Informational responses (100 – 199)
2. Successful responses (200 – 299) ---> 200 for everthing okay, 201 for created ,202 accept,204 no content
3. Redirection messages (300 – 399)
4. Client error responses (400 – 499) ---> 400 bad request, 401 unauthorized,402 payment req,403 borbidden
5. Server error responses (500 – 599) ---> 500 code error

The status codes listed below are defined by RFC 9110.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any part of this text?
